## Part 4: Ethical considerations

1. Provide Datasheets for the Dataset 
We included the datasets in our repository in the folder Datasets. The kaggle data sets are stored in 'data-society-the-simspons-by-the-data' and the scraped csv sheets in 'scraped'. 


2. How did you get the data (legally...)?
We downloaded parts of the data from kaggle and scrapped the other part from the wiki fandom page. We checked beforehand whether or not we were allowed to scrap it in the 'robots.txt' file of the website and with what rate. It turned out that there were no underlying constraints to scrapping the data. 

3. Did you check the source?
We did not check the source due to the nature of the data. It was hard to confirm that the data was accurate, because there are no secondary sources and we would have needed to watch a lot of Simpsons episode. However, since parts of the group were big simpson fans we got the feeling that the data wasnt completly wrong at least. 

### Are there considerations about the analysis you made?
### Did you have to make decisions that affect the analysis?
### What are the limitations of your analysis and your conclusions?

7. Who are the stakeholders of your project?

We are the only stakeholders of the project.

8. Who can benefit from this project, who can be harmed, who is excluded, etc.

In general it is safe to say that simpson Fans can benefit from this project or people who might want to get into to the show and are looking for indicators of good seasons. Unfortanetly, non binary people are excluded from our analysis of the rating for the episodes, because there was no data on them.
