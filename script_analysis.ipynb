thrown a party now were gonna pay back all the friends whove invited us to their homes oh theyre here how does everything look do we have enough glasses homer homer put a record on children go now homer go easy on the al-ky-hol remember last year at the winfields party when you threw up in the laundry hamper i must apologize for my husband hmmm thank you i will dr hibbert thanks for coming i have never been so embarrassed in my life come here shhh i want to make sure the kids dont hear when i was young i always hated knowing my parents were fighting homer do you remember the way you acted at the party last night homer i like to think that im a patient tolerant woman and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you but last night you didnt just cross that line you threw up on it im going to church alone today youre going to stay here and explain to bart why you scarred him for life well be there were going to this retreat to give our marriage a tune-up and thats all no fishing oh that must be the babysitter hello im mrs simpson oh my where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice grampa grampa could you do something well i was wondering do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend i wouldnt ask except im desperate now if maggie runs a fever you call this number if she sticks her finger in an electrical socket call this number and if she drinks pine cleanser call this all right all right goodbye children and behave yourselves call this number if grampa falls in the bathtub hello reverend were glad we could come oh hello helen oh homer well its not that i dont love the guy im always sticking up for him its just that hes so self-centered he forgets birthdays anniversaries holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open he gambles he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes he blows his nose on the towels and puts them back in the middle he drinks out of the carton he never changes the baby when he goes to sleep he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises oh oh and he scratches himself with his keys i guess thats it oh no wait he kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow thats all i can think of right now i guess youre all tired and i want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest homer youre sneaking out to go fishing i cant believe your selfishness you can go fishing anytime but were here trying to save our marriage youre thinking about fishing even when im talking right now right yes get back in bed sure homer do i have to do this we came to this retreat because i thought our marriage was in trouble but i never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble homer how can you expect me to believe to who all this fish represents is just how selfish you are oh yeah sure ohhh homer oh my the house looks wonderful grampa whats your secret kids could you lighten up a little were here so did you kids have fun ohhh homer dont gloat homer you know bart when i was your age the one thing i wanted more than anything in the world was a child-sized electric lightbulb oven my parents wouldnt give me the money so i went to my sisters patty and selma for months i worked and worked while my sisters smoked and smoked but the big day finally came and because id worked for it all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good so maybe a part-time job is the answer the poor boy is so desperate he wants to earn money to buy a comic book i dont think so did you make any money well i think what youre doing for mrs glick is very nice the poor old thing doesnt have anybody i thought you boys might like some milk and microwave smores homer its really coming down could you check on the boys boys you better come in the house you dont want to get the sniffles now come on you can play your little tie-up game inside ive got some cocoa on the stove who wants imitation marshmallows what are you doing honey lisa we did the best we could whats a zebu a-positive a mother knows everything about her family four b sixteen permanent eight baby xl i dont want you wearing rings it looks cheap but three butterscotch and imitation butterscotch glow in the dark monster make-up oh homie you have lots of hair why did you want to know your blood type bart does bart you have to help someone in need its the only decent thing to do the meaning of what homer you dont do things like that to be rewarded you do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand we got exactly what we wanted out of this we gave an old man a second chance but hes your boss do you have to mail it right this minute youre still angry homer why dont you sleep on it please homie for me homer breakfast is ready oh thank you homer i dont think its in the cornstarch canister homer you encouraged him you should be strangling yourself honey whats done is done no matter what happens well pull through we always do oh my its mr burns it doesnt do anything whatever it does its doing it now homer its the thought that counts the moral of this story is a good deed is its own reward well then i guess the moral is no good deed goes unrewarded well then i guess the moral is the squeaky wheel gets the grease but it certainly was a memorable few days bart watch maggie while i get the laundry maggie bart i asked you to watch your sister i washed it now homer dont panic you have plenty of white shirts i dont know how this could have happened homer please no ones going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work homer this is an intimate psychological profile i cant fill this out for you oh my god mother was right i told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house i said crazy house crazy house crazy house doctor if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son bart youd see how sane he is oh homie well at least we got a free sample of reading digest no it is not the truth homer its well documented that women are safer drivers than men youve certainly taken a shine to that magazine homer he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article homie put down your magazine for a minute i thought you might want to snuggle thank you homie it certainly has enriched our lives bart maybe this is something youd like to do too hows it going honey well when i used to

hes trying to be friendly you know if you gave ned flanders a chance -- we cant hold it against him just because he has things a little better than we do -- oh homer hi ned homer sends his apologies but uh there was some important work at the plant that only he could take care of bart how many hours a day do you watch tv dont you think you should get a little fresh air and maybe some exercise thats the problem even as we speak millions of children are staring at the tv instead of getting some much-needed exercise those childrens parents should be ashamed of themselves that sounds fine bart so bart what did you learn in karate school today bart dont use the touch of death on your sister homer this is the flanders entire living room set how much did you pay for this seventy-five dollars ned must be desperate you got a job doing what bart your father and i dont want you doing that homer say something homer homer i know its good for a boy to have a part-time job but im not sure about

smoking hole in the ground ill try to be a better christian i dont know what i can do ummm oooh the next time theres a canned food drive ill give the poor something theyd actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix homer did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham and whats all this for heroic competence for narrowly averting a melt-down and proving without question that nuclear power is completely safe employee-of-the-month ohh homer how are you enjoying your ham homie hmm its actually more of a honey glaze -- bart dont feed your sister hotels i think that game is too old for her why dont you go play with milhouse you mean you still havent made up with him mrs van houten im barts mother -- we met in the emergency room when the boys drank paint look i know bart can be a handful but i also know what hes like inside hes got a spark its not a bad thing of course it makes him do bad things well i cant defend everything he does but lets face it all bart and milhouse have is each other theyre too young for girls and theyre a popular target for bullies and in the christmas pageant theyre always sheep please please let them be friends well i knew his mother would come to her senses what makes you think i did it you be good hello oh hello mrs pennycandy oh dear this is the fifth time hes cancelled how can he hurt someone who loves him so well thank you for calling good-bye

thank you his name is bart uh i dont want to judge the rightness of your ego orientation but my inner critic says you shouldve done your job i knew it if only i had nagged more thats not fair the lesson here is that self-improvement is better left to people who live in big cities homer i have to go out to pick up something for dinner moneys too tight for steak sure steak i know you think the junior campers are square and uncool but they also do a lot of neat things like sing-a-longs and flag ceremonies homer you should be more supportive homer still no help yes hi hober dote kiss be ib

career as a box maker i dont know bart youre only ten well bart its time to get ready for the show honey i know you feel a little silly saying the same four words over and over but you shouldnt youre making people happy and thats a very hard thing to do the best performance of your life i saved these for you bart youll always have them to remind you of the time when you were the whole worlds special little guy yes hes raking leaves if he wants to make it up to you so badly i think you should let him it certainly is exotic lisa is that too spicy for you apu we usually store our cans in the cupboard hmm oh were low on milk for maggie you wanna come with me to the kwik-e-mart well i guess we could go to that new monstromart ooh thats a good price for twelve pounds of nutmeg but thats the longest apu youve been so helpful if it werent for him wed still be in line at the monstromart their floors are sticky-mart i guess weve learned that happiness is wherever you find it how did it go oh thatll work out great were out of lucky charms that sounds like a good movie that toy isnt safe for a baby like maggie i understand honey when i was your age there was a hm i dont know if its a good idea to do that while youre driving lisa -- ordinarily id say you should stand up for what you believe in but you have been doing that an awful lot lately i had a malibu stacy when i was little and i turned out all right now lets forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream honey youre not going to throw red paint at the executives are you the keebler people were very upset im sorry homie well we respect you bart i told you dont draw on your fathers skull pride you know homer when i found out about this i went through a wide range of emotions first i was nervous then anxious then wary then apprehensive then kinda sleepy then worried and then concerned but now i realize that being a spaceman is something you have to do homer when i met you you werent an astronaut you didnt even know how to use a touchtone but i still respected you and i always will no matter what homer you already dialed but on the other hand when you dont take advantage of an opportunity you can end up regretting it for the rest of your life oh i am so proud of you and i know its going to go just fine dont worry kids im sure your fathers all right who wants ginger snaps homie you should be proud only a handful of people have done what youve done bart do you have something nice to say to your father those arent tickets to the game homer oooh the walls are melting again homer thats not god

proud of you but dont you think youre spending too much time with ned your family needs you too that was you there i hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch but why would the advisory board

find that escape is impossible now each one of you take a floor and get started fine oh bart cleaning doesnt have to be a chore here work to the music youre not done i want you to throw away these old calendars and tv guides stop remembering tv and get back to work homer whats going on down there then stop screaming so loud there isnt that a lot better now you can do whatever you want but dont mess up the house or double-ply windows they look just like regular windows but theyll save us four percent on our heating bill well they will homer it looks like it could gore bart i really think this is a bad idea ew homer there is a bird on your head stampys food bill today was three hundred dollars oh my lord a female deer get a rope bart homie this is just what happened at the caramel factory gosh i thought hed be happier in his true habitat then why is he attacking all those other elephants bart this isnt the kind of thing i normally would think was a good idea but you wouldnt have to live with mr burns youd just get all of his money someday this could provide for your entire future uh sure ive gotta stop fantasizing about lee majors ah one more no its not i think bart and lisa are feeling a little upset right now isnt there something youd like to say are you thinking what im thinking no you know bart since he is giving you all of his money maybe it would be nice if you spend some time with him cmon honey bart dont throw peas at your sister homer say something im very concerned mr burns has stolen our son and he wont give him back you know we should really stop hiring him

way the schools being run whats going on in there it says freddy quimby beat a waiter half to death those quimby children are so wild and rich i hope he finally gets whats coming to him well bart your uncle arthur used to have a saying shoot em all and let god sort em out unfortunately one day he put his theory into practice it took seventy-five federal marshals to bring him down now lets never speak of him again hmm honey you should listen to your heart and not the voices in your head like a certain uncle did one grey december morn good for you homie you know a lot of things happened around

perot pamphlet say ive got a neat idea why dont you go in and pick up my mother and well all go out to dinner thats not my mother you know mom you and abe have a lot in common umm you both got swindled by that telemarketing scam well i think its wonderful that your father has fallen in love with my mother bart homer what possible reason could you have against grampa being in love hello mom

ya i love ya i love ya i love ya mom gotta go moms almost ready for her date she sure seems taken by this new beau i feel so bad for grampa hes an awful awful awful man but i guess if he makes mom happy thats all that really matters mom you cant marry mr burns hes an evil man what about abe simpson dont you have any feelings for him were all aware of grampas problems but compared to mr burns hes judge freaking reinhold hm hm we dont think youre slow but on the other hand its not like you go to museums or read books or anything oh homie if you feel so bad about yourself theres always things you can do to feel better theres that or you could take an adult education course thats because you were drunk homer thats supposed to be leather patches on a tweed blazer not the other way around youve ruined a perfectly good jacket whatever do you mean i dont dye my hair i dont know what youre talking about thats nice homer i really dont like you telling personal secrets in your class today at the kwik-e-mart everybody knew i dyed my hair mm-hmm im happy about that but i think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy homer dont ever tell them personal stuff about me again homer dont you have to get to class oh well that will be what the darn homer i want this to end now all right okay everybody out get out get out get out you too get out you just dont get it do you homer you told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldnt i cant trust you anymore kids your father and i are going through a really tough time right now and i dont know whats going to happen but just remember that both your mom and your dad love you very very much but isnt that a sin funny the way everything reminds me of homer oh my im very flattered but im not really interested why dont you come inside for a drink of water heres your water moe homer what happened to you oh here let me help you homer thats not a good thing but how do i know i can trust you i must admit you really do make a gal feel needed and i have a special present for you but ill give it to you later tonight homer the fridge wasnt meant to be used this way although i must say its certainly refreshing wont this overload the motor is it true we should wait at least an hour after eating before we go in who could that be bart are all these children friends of yours oh look theres bart wave to him hmm maybe we should spend more time with bart hes becoming isolated and weird this was a lovely idea homie come here and kiss me i wish youd stop spreading bad rumors about people remember how you got grampa tarred and feathered my these seas are certainly heaving does that earring mean youre a pirate lisa stop blowing my sex i mean stop blowing your sax your sax stop it im sorry but i sacrificed a very expensive camera just to get some quiet time what what i dont know honey i guess thats the schools decision to make lisa i am nice homer i really appreciate you making dinner but this food tastes a little strange but the grocery store sells sugar for thirty-five cents a pound well youll always be number one to me uh i meant my number one girl oh for chri honey if you get too competitive youll never be happy no matter how good you are theres always gonna be someone better than you i always thought i had the tallest hair but that trip to graceland really opened my eyes believe me honey shes more scared of you than you are of her while you were out earning that dollar you lost forty dollars by not going to work the plant called and said if you dont come in tomorrow dont bother coming in monday homer homer homer i want you to forget about guarding this stupid sugar youre being completely paranoid homer when are you gonna give up this crazy sugar scheme look just get rid of the sugar okay im sorry homie this romance is so full of heartfelt passion i can really identify with this corn-fed heroine homer are you awake this is important give me some sign youre awake wake up homie do you think that the romance has gone out of our lives wake up its nine thirty pm and you spent your whole saturday drinking beer in maggies kiddy pool i can hit that one pin all right but the rest of them dont even wobble homer young people learn about love from adults and weve been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general i want us to deal with the issues raised by this book i knew i shouldnt have put a fireplace in the bedroom how many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon yes they do and when was the last time you heard anyone talk about ren and stimpy children your father and i have fed you and clothed you but weve neglected something more important its time to learn about love i mean romance not love thats not true romance is all around us in our neighborhoods even on our jobs all you have to do is think about your most cherished memories no no no no ask your heart what its fondest desire is no think about people about moments in your life that have been very romantic thats not the idea at all okay well this story isnt ideal ive never told it to you before i got a very thoughtless birthday present from someone who shall remain nameless so i actually went to the bowling alley to spite him or her oh im awfully sorry oh no no homer is my balls name im marge no no thank you mr uh brunswick jacques hmmm sure never no oh i dont want to trouble you all right but im not very good oh but youre a very good teacher you didnt have to drop me off oh jacques im a married woman whats brunch you didnt have to drop me off he seemed to know a lot about brunch but it turned out he wasnt interested in brunch at all that doesnt shock me is thursday okay thank goodness i drove down an ironic street i made the right decision to stay with my homie and there was no harm done so if you kind of mentally snip out the part where i already had a husband thats my idea of romance okay homer this was a wonderful idea homie yes what did happen to her good does anyone else have a love story lisa not all romances turn out that way bart do you have a love story that doesnt end in heartbreak well as jerry lee lewis would say theres a whole lotta frowning going on of course remember when your aunt selma got married oh wait wait thats no good i know your grandfather it all started on an outing for dinner say ive got a neat idea why dont you go in and pick up my mother and well all go out to dinner thats not my mother they hit it off right away but there were rivals for the fair ladys hand but in the end just when things looked worse true love triumphed i give up did anybody learn anything about love tonight theres that side of it but theres also help me out here lisa well kids i tried maybe youre right gee artie artie wait i dont know i mean it was it was a beautiful evening lets not ruin it artie please no oh artie now really i mean it now stop it take me home artie yeah right

planned our vacation were going to the highway 9 bird sanctuary i understand theyve installed a new bird feeder this year its shaped like a diner and its on this really tall pole hmm oooh recipe-related bumper cars now wait a minute im not sure about this every time weve ever gone on vacation i end up being horribly embarrassed we end up in a big fight and we come home more miserable than when we left you have to promise me that this isnt going to happen this time well there was our trip to the amish country even worse was our trip to sandy beach this year i want us to do things together as a family and get a lot of good exercise outdoors so well have a lot of wonderful memories of our vacation and remember every morning give one bowl of kibble to santas little helper do you want me to write any of this down whats the matter with you homer we dont have any fruits or vegetables in the car wed better find a motel and stop for the night homer no youre going to get lost such a violent motif oh please it was just a figure of speech when do you show the consequences on tv that mouse pulled out that cats lungs and played them like a bagpipe but in the next scene the cat was breathing comfortably bart homer we just got here and already im mortified beyond belief by your embarrassing behavior oh i see all right ill have the baby guts oh youre sure shell have fun here tortureland explosion land searing gas pain land unnecessary surgery land its cute but im sure its very sharp and probably dirty see all that stuff in there homer thats why your robot never worked this is just what i was hoping for spending the day together as a family ah you know part of spending time together as a family is spending time apart as individuals yuh-huh im sure well appreciate each other all the more when we meet up at dinner are you kids gonna be alright kids hey the bartender even looks like john travolta it must be wonderful to ring in the new year over and over and over i want all five t-shirts to say best vacation ever im so embarrassed i wish there was a hole i could just crawl into and die stay away from me homer i have nothing to say to you how were you a political prisoner oh for gosh sakes what now i knew we should have gone to the bird sanctuary oh my it looks like were doomed i dont approve of that are you two bonkers we almost got killed not to mention all the embarrassment i suffered you know youre right this truly was the best vacation ever now let us never speak of it again i hope you realize now that violence on tv may be funny but its not so funny when that violence is happening to you oh my lisa go to your room this sounds awfully controversial lisa you know i dont like controversy in this house bart i wish you wouldnt lie like that homer weve got to stop them homer did you remember to lock the front door of the house when you locked the front door did you remember to lock the back door homer im impressed youre taking this quite well homer were just gonna have to wait and see homer homie hm what hes typed will be a window into his madness feelin fine well thats a relief this is less encouraging go crazy you stay here

commode mouth besides you kids need to learn morals and decency and how to love your fellow man i dont want you playing with something that has such bizarre hair awful awful hair oh thats sweet homer our son is growing up isnt he have you noticed any change in bart no he looks like something might be disturbing him i guess we could get more involved in barts activities but then id be afraid of smothering him thats not what i meant time for church bart i bet your little friend jessica will be there thirty cents off shake n bake homer homer stop that i believe him thats what he wore to church bart honey do you know who did take the money we really shouldnt have let them do this it cant be helping his self esteem uh i think you all owe my son an apology lisa your father and i are very concerned about this warning i really hope you try harder cheer up so youre not good at sports its a very small part of life i think lisa needs to feel a little special tonight how about letting her ride up front too well i think women should be able to play any sport men play but hockey is so violent and dangerous look at milhouses teeth no i cant even watch i dont know how you two can sit here

but she wouldnt listen besides standing by you and supporting you there isnt anything more i can do homer thats your solution to everything to move under the sea its not gonna happen look maybe this whole thing will blow over yes yes yes thats fine good good oh really i hope you kept the homie fires burning homer homer homie the kids have a great idea on how you can clear your name well we can dress it up a bit we can bring a fern and a folding chair from the garage and the most decorative thing of all the truth there are only forty-nine stars on that flag you know the courts might not work anymore but as long as everybody is videotaping everyone else justice will be done groundskeeper willie saved you homer hasnt this experience taught you you cant believe everything you hear is there

cigar box dug up in the backyard but the gun wasnt there have you seen it i was just asking if youd seen it theres no need to be a prickly pear were you talking to me grampa the police have such a strong case against homer mr burns said he did it they have homers dna no no no when i took your fathers name i took everything that came with it including dna no we cant start thinking that way about

your grandfather is not psycho the only thing hes straight-up is loves you its so sad that grampa has to cheat instead of relying on his god-given wrestling skills what kind of person revels in disapproval your behavior at that game was unacceptable youre lucky they gave you your participant trophy i know your grampa seems exciting now but all that preening and cheating those turnbuckle antics are not gonna make him happy i dont care if bart is a wrestler a busboy or even a stoplight squeegee man as long as hes a nice person but if he gets too much attention for acting bad he might

that trouble just for me humph where would an innocent child get the idea to attack her father with a mallet no maggie bad baby so televisions responsible well you wont be watching these cartoons anymore ever i wonder why bart and lisa are so late getting home from school because because i said so homer im trying to work im cataloguing the violence in these cartoons i dont think adults have ever actually sat down and watched them before what kind of warped human being would find that funny this is the kind of entertainment they think is suitable for younger and more impressionable viewers ill tell you what im going to do im going to write a letter dear purveyors of senseless violence i know this may sound silly at first but i believe that the cartoons you show to our children are influencing their behavior in a negative way please try to tone down the psychotic violence in your otherwise fine programming yours truly marge simpson and the horse i rode in on well thats what we want them to do homer well ive never changed the world before so i dont know how long it takes exactly but if enough people take an interest snuh it stands for springfieldians for nonviolence understanding and helping ive started a crusade against cartoon violence i can protect my own children but there are many others whose minds are being warped every afternoon at four all right have fun and what happens when a child grows up with insanely violent role models like these the answer is all around you how many of you were hit on the head with mallets last week no no im sorry about the dinners ill make up for it tomorrow night no one hmmm sure oh dear i cant ive got three protest rallies tomorrow what do we want when do we want it what do we want her group substantially-less violence-in childrens-program-ming krusty no youre ruining the show oh oh oh stop please stop please be quiet oh please all right im trying to earn a living here all right stop stop so much needless brutality i dont know if im having any impact at all mmmmmmmph what is it what smartline yes ive heard of your late-night panel discussion show well id love to excuse me excuse me he was addressing me excuse me there is i think that its a bad influence on children ohhh yes id like to ask all the parents in springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel thank you hello yes yes well whats the problem youre having huh huh oh dear well lets see oh couldnt itchy share his pie with scratchy then they would both have pie its time for krusty yes dear all you want i think it conveys a very nice message of sharing arent you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons so what did you kids do today thats nice dear sure i didnt really expect things to change this much what in the world hmmm but thats michelangelos david its a masterpiece but i like that statue im not i think everyone in springfield should see it hmmm yes and no well i guess i cant which is a shame because i really hate those cartoons um i dont know i guess one person can make a difference but most of the time they probably shouldnt david oh homie here the kids have a chance to see a great work of art and instead theyre home watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other really why aw well isnt that nice bart bart oh bart we thought for a minute youd gone away from us mr hutz this is hardly the time or place to discuss this is he well enough for me to start mothering him unbearably doctor hmmm oh homer thats right he did excuse me but dr hibbert has been our family physician for years and he thought bart was fine well maybe lisa does have a point i dont mind you boys doing this in the living room but in court doesnt bart have to tell the truth i didnt know you liked animals goodness i dont know maybe we should take his money and put all this ugliness behind us what do you think homer homer whats happened to you all this greediness and lying and shifty lawyers and phony doctors -- do you know what id settle for if it was up to me barts medical bills and an apology yes i do yes hes been our family physician and trusted friend ever since the day i became a mother hes seen us through everything from colds to impetigo with competence and loving care im sorry but my mother always said if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all well to be honest he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping bart in bandages than in making him feel better and he mispronounced words that even i know like abdomen and his office was dirty now that i think about it im not sure hes even a doctor well i dont know how intense it was but well i guess he did miss three days of school -- although he doesnt really like school all that much so i guess that may not count as anguish it was a little hard on me having him around the house all that time well we pay bart five dollars a week to take out the trash i suppose if hed been able to do it that week we might have given him the five dollars um-hmm homer would you like some more macaroni and cheese some string beans some celery with cream cheese on it bart please sure my womans intuition is telling me something i wonder what oh my god my name is marge homer id like you to forgive me for doing the right thing weve squabbled over money before -- never this much -- i mean i know this is different than that time i washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket but i-- what are you saying homer oh my lord well i dont want to wait another minute to find out whether you love me anymore i think that you should look me in the eyes and find out homer look at me i love you too your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds homer get it while its unbelievably hot kids well maybe lisas

father and i first met and fell in love we were seniors in high school but we had never even met im for equal rights but do we really need a whole amendment not if i have to do heavy lifting or math oh the shop kids are smoking again and in another article i found out that to hire professionals to do all the jobs of a housewife who incidentally is not married to a house would cost forty-eight
